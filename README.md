Okay, listen, let me be frank here. I made this while I was incredibly sick and I think it, like, fucked up my brain a bit. This is some of the worst code that I have ever written and I feel shame for it. If you're going to go dumpster diving through this then good luck.

For all intents and purposes, it _works_ (I think...), and has a practical purpose and is something I can see myself using. Adding new formats is as easy as making a JSON file, copying `Entity.svelte`, and changing it to match your new file. And that should be it. I'll try to make this easier in the future as this is far from finished but for now it's in an okay state, I think.
